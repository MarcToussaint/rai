 * * cmaes_boundary_transformation_exit(this)
 * * cmaes_boundary_transformation(this, x, y, len)
 *
 * implements a smooth mapping double *x -> double *y that guarantees
 * elements of y to be within specified boundaries. The mapping is piecewise
 * either linear or quadratic and can achieve values arbitrarily close to and
 * on the boundaries. The middle of the domain l_bound + (u_bound-l_bound) / 2.0
 * always maps to itself. Typically, 90% of feasible values (those not close 
 * to the boundaries) are mapped to themselves, preventing any numerical subtleties. 
 * Specifically, al, au > 0 are internally chosen offsets. The mapping
 * [l_bound - al, u_bound + au] <-> [l_bound, u_bound] is monotonous, bijective
 * and invertible. It is the identity within [l_bound + al, u_bound - au] and 
 * quadratic for [l_bound - 3*al, l_bound + al] (with l_bound - al -> l_bound)
 * and for [u_bound - au, u_bound + 3*au] (with u_bound + au -> u_bound).
 *
 * The method is robust against very small/large boundary values, say
 * -1e99 and/or 1e99, to emulated unbounded variables. In this case values
 * between -1e98 and 1e98 are never changed, i.e. mapped to itself.
